# OOP-Game---JAVA
This game was developed using Java on Eclipse IDE using free assets.

Some of the codings are messy, however it should be functioning fine. Lots of unused resources are still in the resource file. This is due to the game being used and presented once only, and created by a single person for academic purposes therefore coding maintanance are not of high priority
